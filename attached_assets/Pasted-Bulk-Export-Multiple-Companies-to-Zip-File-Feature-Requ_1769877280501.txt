Bulk Export Multiple Companies to Zip File
Feature Request: Multi-Company Bulk Export with Multiple Format Options
I need to export the same type of report for multiple companies at once from the Saved Reports screen, with all reports compiled into a single zip file download.
Requirements:

Multi-Select UI (shares infrastructure with Bulk Update)

Same checkbox system as bulk update feature
Same select all / select by group functionality
Support selecting up to 100 companies maximum
Show warning when approaching limit: "98/100 companies selected"


Export Configuration Modal
When "Export Selected" is clicked, show a modal with options:
Report Format Selection:

Word Document (.docx)
PDF (.pdf)
Excel Spreadsheet (.xlsx)
Markdown (.md)
JSON (.json)

Allow selecting only ONE format per export (all reports in zip will be same format)
Report Type Selection:

Company Overview (default)
Financial Summary
Competitive Analysis
Full Research Report
Custom Template (if user has saved templates)

File Naming Convention:

Default: {company_name}_{report_type}_{date}.{ext}
Option to customize: prefix, include investor group, date format

Export Preview:

Show list of companies to be exported
Show estimated file count and approximate zip size
"Export X reports as .docx files"


Export Processing

Generate reports sequentially to manage memory
Show progress modal:

"Generating report X of Y: [Company Name]"
Progress bar
Cancel button


Create zip file on server as reports are generated
Stream download when complete (don't hold entire zip in memory)


Zip File Structure:
export_2026-01-31.zip
   ├── AEA/
   │   ├── Company_A_overview_2026-01-31.docx
   │   ├── Company_B_overview_2026-01-31.docx
   │   └── ...
   ├── StonePeak/

   │   └── ...
   └── export_manifest.json  (metadata about export)

Export Manifest (export_manifest.json):
{
     "exportDate": "2026-01-31T14:30:00Z",
     "totalCompanies": 71,
     "reportType": "Company Overview",
     "format": "docx",
     "companies": [
       {
         "name": "Company A",
         "group": "AEA",
         "filename": "AEA/Company_A_overview_2026-01-31.docx",
         "generatedAt": "2026-01-31T14:30:05Z",
         "lastResearchUpdate": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z"
       }
     ],
     "failed": []
   }
Error Handling:

If a report fails to generate, include error in manifest and continue
At completion, show summary with any failures
Option to retry failed reports or download partial zip
Include placeholder file for failed reports: {company}_FAILED.txt with error details


Format-Specific Considerations:
Word (.docx):

Use company branding/logo if available
Include table of contents for full reports
Professional formatting with headers/footers

PDF (.pdf):

Generated from same template as Word
Include bookmarks for navigation
Optimized for printing

Excel (.xlsx):

Structured data in tabular format
Multiple sheets: Summary, Financials, Competitors, etc.
Include company logo in header
Formatted for analysis

Markdown (.md):

Clean, readable format
Good for import into other systems
Include YAML frontmatter with metadata

JSON (.json):

Complete structured data export
Includes all research data fields
Schema-documented format
Good for programmatic access


Performance Optimizations:

Queue large exports (>20 companies) as background jobs
Allow user to receive email notification when export is ready
Cache recently generated reports to speed up repeat exports
Set timeout per report generation (30 seconds max)
Memory limit per export job


Download Management:

Generate unique download link valid for 24 hours
Store export in temporary storage
Clean up expired exports automatically
Show download history in user profile



Database Schema Additions:
bulk_exports:
  - id (uuid)
  - user_id
  - company_ids (array)
  - report_type
  - format
  - status (enum: pending, generating, ready, expired, failed)
  - progress (int, 0-100)
  - file_path
  - file_size
  - download_url
  - expires_at
  - created_at
  - manifest (jsonb)

API Endpoints Needed:

POST /api/bulk-export/start - Initiate export job
GET /api/bulk-export/status/:jobId - Check export progress
GET /api/bulk-export/download/:jobId - Download zip file
POST /api/bulk-export/cancel/:jobId - Cancel export
GET /api/bulk-export/history - List user's export history


Implementation Notes
Shared Components:
Both features share the multi-select infrastructure. Build the selection system first, then add the specific actions.
Recommended Implementation Order:

Multi-select checkbox UI with select all/group functionality
Floating action bar component
Bulk update feature (simpler, good for testing selection logic)
Bulk export feature (more complex with format options)

State Management:
Consider using React context or Zustand to manage selected companies state, as it needs to persist across component rerenders and be accessible from multiple UI elements.
Testing:

Test with large selections (100 companies)
Test cancellation mid-process
Test network failures during bulk operations
Test concurrent bulk operations from same user
