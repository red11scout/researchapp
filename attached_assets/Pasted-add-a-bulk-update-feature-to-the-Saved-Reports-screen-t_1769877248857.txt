add a bulk update feature to the Saved Reports screen that allows me to refresh company research for multiple companies at once.
Requirements:

Multi-Select UI on Saved Reports Screen

Add checkboxes to each company row in the saved reports list
Add a "Select All" checkbox in the header that toggles all visible companies
Add a "Select All in Group" option for bulk selecting all companies under a specific investor/group (e.g., all 54 AEA companies, all 17 StonePeak companies)
Show a floating action bar when 1+ companies are selected displaying:

Count of selected companies: "X companies selected"
"Update Selected" button
"Clear Selection" button




Bulk Update Processing

When "Update Selected" is clicked, show a confirmation modal:

"Update research for X companies? This may take several minutes."
Estimated time based on company count (e.g., ~2 min per company)
Option to run in background or stay on page


Process updates sequentially to avoid rate limits on research APIs
Show progress indicator:

"Updating company X of Y: [Company Name]"
Progress bar showing percentage complete
List of completed companies with status (success/failed)
Ability to cancel remaining updates




Background Processing Option

Allow user to initiate bulk update and navigate away
Store update job status in database with:

Job ID
Companies to update (array)
Current progress
Start time
Status (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)


Show notification badge on Saved Reports when background job is running
Show toast notification when background job completes


Error Handling

If a company update fails, log the error and continue with remaining companies
At completion, show summary:

"X of Y companies updated successfully"
List of failed companies with retry option


Store last successful update timestamp per company


UI/UX Considerations

Preserve existing filter/sort state during selection
Clear selection when switching between investor groups
Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+A to select all visible, Escape to clear selection
Selected row highlighting for visual feedback



Database Schema Additions:
bulk_update_jobs:
  - id (uuid)
  - user_id
  - company_ids (array)
  - status (enum: pending, in_progress, completed, failed, cancelled)
